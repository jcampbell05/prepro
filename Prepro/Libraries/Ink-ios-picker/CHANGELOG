- Automatically reload local images if you switch out of the context. Nice for taking screenshots, coming back to the app
  and having them show up with out having to reload
- Making sure the "No Pictures" empty label is correctly removed when photos exist
- Renaming the function names to avoid collisions in Categories. UIImage+FPAFNetworking in particular.
- Passing back errors, not just as a cancel
- Using obj BOOL rather then C booleans
- Flags to help with appstore approval in Bundle/FilepickerSettings.plist
    - OnlyResolveAllowedLists will only allow whitelisted urls to be opened, preventing users from getting to a payment screen
      that the app store frowns on
    - HideAllLinks will actually hide all 'a' links. All the login pages worked when released.
- Both of these are flags because their ability to do the right thing (allow login but nothing else) is dependent on other moving
  parts like the api providers. Feel free to add to AllowedUrlPrefix.plist to help maintain an up to date list.
- Use both of these flags carefully

v1.1.1 - General Stability Fixes - 07/19/2012

- Images are now rotated properly before being sent up to the server. This affects both the Camera and the Camera Roll
- Camera Roll no longer reuses cells; solves problem of not reseting the touch handler and imageview properly
- HUD now shows up quickly on the Camera and Camera Roll without needless delay
- FPPicker now retains the delegate. This is to prevent crashing. While still being able to call back to the delegate may not be proper behavior, it doesn't crash. Async uploads, coming soon, will handle this better.
- File uploads happen in multiple parts. This is to address a bug where the server times out.
- Namespacing. All external libraries, AFNetworking, JSONKit, MBProgressHUD and PullRefreshTable are now prefixed with 'FP' to prevent the duplicate symbol definition bug
